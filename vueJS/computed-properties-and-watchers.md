### Computed Properties and Watchers

n-template expressions are very convenient, but they are really only meant for simple operations. Putting too much logic into your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. 

At this point, the template is no longer simple and declarative. You have to look at it for a second before realizing that it displays message in reverse. The problem is made worse when you want to include the reversed message in your template more than once.

That’s why for any complex logic, you should use a computed property.

##### example

###### HTML
```
<div id="example">
  <p>Original message: "{{ message }}"</p>
  <p>Computed reversed message: "{{ reversedMessage }}"</p>
</div>
```
###### JS
```
var vm = new Vue({
  el: '#example',
  data: {
    message: 'Hello'
  },
  computed: {
    // a computed getter
    reversedMessage: function () {
      // `this` points to the vm instance
      return this.message.split('').reverse().join('')
    }
  }
})
```
